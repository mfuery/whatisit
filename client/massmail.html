        <p>The core of the application is the ability to post
          different types of messages (massmail, chat, post, etc.) to the network. Through
          permissioning employees have access to the types of posts and information that
          is most relevant to them. We use a custom algorithm to prioritize which posts
          are sent and seen by whom.</p>
